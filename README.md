Testing out a scrolling feature

I was doing some research on how Apple gets those really cool scrolling effects on their website. 
Apparently, its just a ton of images pre-loaded directly into the document, and sifted w/ a basic scroll tracker.

I achieved a similar effect here with a few images a rotating block render

Hope to add more complex renders in the future, along with multiple elements.
